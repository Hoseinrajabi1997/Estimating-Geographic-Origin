#Methods Utilized:
- Linear Regression
- Gaussian Process Regression
- Automatic Relevance Determination
- Bayesian Ridge Regression
- Huber Regression
- Bagging Regression
- Multi-layer Perceptron
- Random Forest Regression
- Support Vector Regression
- Decision Tree Regression

#Dataset
Total of 1986 chromosomes
Two main clusters: South Asia and East Asia
1812841 features detailing distinct biological traits

#Results
Achieved a test set accuracy of 92.33%.
Applied various supervised learning algorithms to predict the exact geographic location of genomic origi
